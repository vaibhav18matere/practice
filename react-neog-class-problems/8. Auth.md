1. Create a folder private and add private pages (eg: an address page) to it. Now show the Address page only if a user is logged ( if the login variable is true - no need to add any state) else redirect to the login page.

- Concepts : Route 
2. Using state create a login button and accordingly show the address page and login page.

3. Create a RequiresAuth component and show the element based on login status

- Concepts : Conditional Routing
4. Convert useState to useContext. Create useAuth() context hook to check if a user is logged in or not.

- [solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-auth-03-solution-forked-iq1585?file=/src/context/auth-context.js)
- Concepts : 
  - useContext and useAuth to separate the logic
  - Add AuthProvider
5. Navigate the user to the page where he was going, after the successful login. User clicked on "address" and you redirected him to the "login" page so now it's your duty to redirect him to the "address" page.

- [solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-auth-05-question-forked-4ddclb?file=/src/RequiresAuth.js)
- Concepts : 
  - [useNavigation]()
  - [useLocation]()
6. Login using username and password. Set the auth context. Login using mockbee. Revision of API calls and setting auth context.
7. Make the auth persistence. If we refresh the page, make sure the user is still logged in. Revision of localstorage read and write. Read in auth context, when the provider loads (remember useEffect?).
8. Create logout route for user. Create a logoutUser function. Pass it through AuthContext. This should do three things:
- setLogin to false
- Clean localStorage
- Navigate to home page
8. Using authenticated routes on mockbee https://mockbee.netlify.app/docs/api/general/auth/
