### Recursion 
  - Problem solving technique where solution depends on 'solution to smaller instances of the same problem'.

- When function calls itself.

- Always needs a 'base case' i.e. a condition to terminate recursion.

- Doesn't always translate to faster solution.

- Recursive solution may be worse compared to an iterative solution.
