# ALGORITHMS

- Algorithm is set of well defined instructions to solve a perticular way.

### 1. Intro to Algorithm

### 2. Measuring Performance

### 3. Time And Space Complexity

### 4. Big O Notation

### 5. Math Algorithm

## Characteristics

- Well defined Inputs and outputs.
- Each step should be clear and non-ambiguous.
- Language independent.

### Need ‚Åâ

- One problem can be solved in many ways.
- How to know which is better way ?

### Algorithm analysis

- in terms of it's input size

  - TIME COMPLEXITY ‚è≥
  - SPACE COMPLEXITY üåè

- How to represent time and space complexity ?

1. Big O Notation - Worst case complexity ‚úÖ
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity ‚ùå
3. Theta Notation - Average case complexity ‚ùå

### Big O Notation

- describes complexity of algorithm using algebric terms.

#### characterestics

- represent in terms of input.
- focuses on bigger picture without getting caught up in small details.
- Types : constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, logarithmic.

### Space complexity

- Types : constant, linear, quadratic.

#### Note :

1. No single RIGHT solution ‚ùå multiple algorithms exists for the same problem ‚úÖ
2. Same algorithm with same programming language can be implemented using diff. ways ‚úÖ
3. Don't write too cleaver code Wrie code ‚ùå instead focus on writting a code that is simple to read and easy to maintain ‚úÖ

#### Big O for Objects (collection of key-value pair)

1. Insert - O(1)
2. Remove - O(1)
3. Access - O(1)
4. Search - O(n)
5. Object.keys() - O(n)
6. Object.values() - O(n)
7. Object.entries()- O(n)

#### Big O for Arrays (ordered collection of values)

1. Insert / Remove at End- O(1)
2. Insert / Remove at Beginning - O(n)
3. Access - O(1)
4. Search - O(n)
5. Push/Pop - O(1)
6. Shift / unshift / concat / slice / splice - O(n)
7. ForEach / map / filter / reduce - O(n)

#### Big O cheatsheet

1. Calculations not dependent on input size - O(1)
2. Loop - O(n)
3. Nested loops - O(n^2)
4. Input size reduced by half - O(logn)

### Recursion

- Problem solving technique where solution depends on 'solution to smaller instances of the same problem'.

- When function calls itself.

- Always needs a 'base case' i.e. a condition to terminate recursion.

- Doesn't always translate to faster solution.

- Recursive solution may be worse compared to an iterative solution.

### Data Structure

1. Built in Data Structure

- Array
- Object
- Set
- Map

2. Custom Data Structure

- Stack
- Queue
- Circular Queue
- Linked List
- Hash Table
- Tree
- Graph

#### Time complexity of an array

- Insert/remove from end of array - O(1)
- Insert/remove from start of array - O(n)
- Access an array - O(1)
- Search an array - O(n)

#### Time complexity of an Object

- Insert / Remove / Access - O(1)
- Search - O(n)
