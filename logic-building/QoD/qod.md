- otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.
- *Return an array where the `ith` element is the final price you will pay for the `ith` item of the shop considering the special discount.*
- Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3] {`Mango`: 8, `Cherry`: 14, `Banana`: 6, `Chickoo`: 2, `Apple`: 3}}
- Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
- Explanation: 
     - For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
     - For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
     - For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
     - For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
- Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
- Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
- Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
- Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
- Output: [9,0,1,6]
64. You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores.
- At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings ops, where ops[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:
- An integer x - Record a new score of x.
- "+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
- "D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
- "C" - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
- Return the sum of all the scores on the record.
- Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
- Output: 30
- Explanation:
     - "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
     - "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
     - "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
     - "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
     - "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
     - The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
